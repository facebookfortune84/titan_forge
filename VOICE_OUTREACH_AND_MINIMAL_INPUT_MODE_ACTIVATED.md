## 🎯 SYSTEM READINESS SNAPSHOT

### Current State (What Exists)

✅ **Marketing Layer (SPRINT M1 Complete)**
- `swarm/config/businessProfile.yaml` – ICP, offerings, success metrics
- `swarm/config/positioningLayer.yaml` – Messaging, CTAs, email templates
- `swarm/config/coreUserJourney.yaml` – 9-stage funnel, 100+ events
- Documented, locked, ready

✅ **Technical Foundation (5 Sprints Complete)**
- Frontend: React + Vite, landing pages, forms, checkout
- Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis, 20+ endpoints
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose, one-command startup
- Payment: Stripe integration (test + live)

🟡 **Agent Roster (Defined but Not Fully Instantiated)**
- Copy_Agent, Content_Agent, EmailCRM_Agent, Funnel_Agent, Analytics_Agent
- Growth_Orchestrator, SocialMediaManager_Agent
- Not yet: Voice agents, sales sequence agents, advanced analytics agents

❌ **Voice Layer (Doesn't Exist – Will Create)**
- No call scripts, flows, cadences
- No voice campaigns
- No telephony integration schema

### What's Missing (What We'll Build)

**VOICE OUTREACH LOGIC** (SPRINTS V1-V6):
- Call scripts for each campaign
- State machines (flows) for conversations
- Follow-up cadences and timing rules
- Compliance and opt-out logic
- CRM/event integration schema

**MINIMAL INPUT SYSTEM** (Complete automation):
- Every lead routing decision automated
- Every customer interaction sequenced
- Every sales motion templated
- Every followup triggered automatically
- Only human decision: Launch, approve, authorize budget

## 🔥 THE MISSION (3 PHASES)

### PHASE 1: VOICE OUTREACH LOGIC (Sprints V1-V6)
Design complete voice automation layer:
1. V1: Voice business profile & campaign map
2. V2: Call scripts (new leads, trial, renewals, winback)
3. V3: Call flows (state machines, JSON)
4. V4: Follow-up cadences (timing, rules, escalation)
5. V5: CRM/event integration schema
6. V6: Compliance review & refinement

### PHASE 2: SYSTEM COMPLETION (Sprints M/F/A)
Complete remaining marketing/sales logic:
- M2-M8: Landing pages, blog, email, analytics
- F1-F3: Funnel optimization, A/B testing framework
- A1-A3: Advanced automation, upsell logic, churn prevention

### PHASE 3: HYPER TUNING (Final Optimization)
Maximize capabilities until system is saturated:
- Audit gaps and coverage
- Add specialized agents as needed
- Generate variants and A/B tests
- Produce final system summary

## 📊 STARTUP: BEGIN WITH SPRINT V1

I'm beginning:

> SPRINT V1 – Voice Business Profile & Campaign Map

(Will then proceed through V2-V6, then M2-M8, then HYPER TUNING)
