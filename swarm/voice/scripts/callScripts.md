# TitanForge Voice Scripts - V2

## SCRIPT: New Lead Welcome Call

**Campaign:** new_lead_welcome  
**Target:** Solo Developers  
**Goal:** Warm welcome, qualify fit, trial signup  
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes  

---

### Opening (20 seconds)
"Hi [Name], this is [Agent Name] from TitanForge. We received your signup interest today. Do you have a quick minute?"

[Wait for yes]

### Purpose (30 seconds)
"Great. I just wanted to personally thank you for checking us out and make sure we're actually a fit for what you're building. Sound good?"

### Qualification (90 seconds)
"Quick question - what's the biggest bottleneck in your current dev workflow? Are you working solo or with a small team?"

[Listen for pain point]

"Got it. [Pain point]. Yeah, that's super common. That's actually why we built TitanForge - to automate exactly that."

### Value Pitch (60 seconds)
"Basically, our AI agents handle the repetitive stuff - code reviews, test writing, documentation - so you can focus on the creative work. Most of our beta users are shipping 30-40% faster."

"The cool part? You can spin up custom agents for literally any workflow you have."

### Trial Offer (60 seconds)
"I don't want to oversell you. Why don't we set you up with a free trial - no credit card? You'll get access to all the pro features for 14 days. You can kick the tires and see if it actually helps."

[If yes: "Perfect, I'm sending a link to your email right now. It'll take you to the setup page. Any questions?"]

[If hesitant: "What would help you feel more confident trying it?"]

### Close (30 seconds)
"Awesome. You'll get an email in the next minute. Just click that link and you're good to go. And if you hit any snags, just hit reply - we're super responsive."

"Thanks for chatting with me, [Name]. Talk soon!"

## SCRIPT: Trial Expiring - Upgrade Call

**Campaign:** trial_expiring_upsell  
**Target:** Solo Developers (end of trial)  
**Goal:** Convert trial user to Pro plan  
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes  

---

### Opening (20 seconds)
"Hi [Name], it's [Agent Name] from TitanForge. Your trial's wrapping up tomorrow. Got a quick minute?"

### Usage Check (60 seconds)
"So I'm curious - have you had a chance to actually use the agents yet?"

[If yes: "What did you try?" → Listen actively]

[If no: "What got in the way? Or just haven't had bandwidth?"]

### Value Reframing (90 seconds)
"Yeah, I get it. But here's the thing - a lot of people hit their 'aha moment' in week 2, once they've set up their first custom agent. That's when people really start shipping faster."

"Our Pro plan is basically the same features you've been using, just unlimited agents and priority support. It's $99/month. Most users recoup that in saved dev time in like... 2-3 weeks?"

### Objection Handling (variable)
[If "too expensive":] "Fair. What would feel right for you? Or would 3 months at $49/month to test it feel better?"

[If "not sure it's worth it":] "Totally understand. What would need to happen for you to feel confident this was worth the investment?"

### Close (60 seconds)
"Here's what I suggest: convert to Pro today - I'll knock 20% off your first month as a thank you for being an early user - try it for 30 days, and if it's not helping, I'll refund you personally. No questions asked."

"Sound fair?"

[If yes: "Done. Sending you the upgrade link now."]

[If no: "What would make this feel like a safe bet?"]

## SCRIPT: Agency Sales Call (Territory)

**Campaign:** agency_outreach  
**Target:** Dev Agencies  
**Goal:** Identify pain, explore pilot  
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes  

---

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi [Name], it's [Agent Name] from TitanForge. We specialize in automating dev workflows for agencies like yours. Do you have 5 minutes?"

### Relevance (90 seconds)
"Look, the reason I'm calling is: most agencies we talk to have the same two problems. One, client timelines are crazy tight, and two, your margins get eaten up by billable hours on stuff that's... kinda repetitive. Sound familiar?"

### Discovery (2-3 minutes)
"So what's your biggest hiring challenge right now?"
"How many devs are on the team?"
"What kind of projects do you typically take?"
"What's eating up the most dev time that feels like it *shouldn't* be?"

### Pitch (2 minutes)
"The reason I'm calling is, we've built a platform where you can spin up custom AI agents that basically extend your team. They handle code reviews, test generation, documentation - the stuff that eats margin."

"One of our agency clients added $30K/month in net margin in the first 90 days by using agents for pre-delivery QA."

### Pilot (2 minutes)
"Here's what I'd suggest: we set up a 2-week pilot on one of your smaller projects. You see if agents can actually help. If they do, we talk about expanding. If they don't, no harm."

"What would that look like for you?"

### Close (60 seconds)
"Great. I'm going to send you a pilot agreement. Let's grab 30 minutes next week to kick off. Sound good?"
