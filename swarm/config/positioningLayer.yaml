# Common Objections & Rebuttals
objectionsAndRebuttals:
  - objection: "AI code quality is bad"
    rebuttal: "Our agents are trained on thousands of production codebases. They review and refine their own output. Our users report 60% fewer bugs."
    rebuttal_short: "Quality is higher. Our users see 60% fewer bugs."
  
  - objection: "This will replace developers"
    rebuttal: "No. It replaces drudgery. Developers become architects and innovators, not copy-paste machines. You still need humans for creative decisions."
    rebuttal_short: "It replaces tedious tasks, not people."
  
  - objection: "Too expensive"
    rebuttal: "At $99/month, Pro costs less than 1 day of a senior developer. You save that in faster delivery in week 1. ROI is immediate."
    rebuttal_short: "$99/month is 1 day of dev cost. You save that in week 1."
  
  - objection: "Learning curve is steep"
    rebuttal: "Nope. Describe your task in plain English. Agents handle the rest. 80% of users are productive in first session."
    rebuttal_short: "If you can describe code, you can use TitanForge."
  
  - objection: "What about my proprietary code security?"
    rebuttal: "Your code stays on your infrastructure. Agents work within your environment. We never send your code to third parties."
    rebuttal_short: "Your code stays on your hardware. Always."
