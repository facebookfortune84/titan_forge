### Email 3: Unlock More Power (Feature Discovery)
**Trigger:** 3 days into trial  
**Send:** Day 3, 9 AM (user timezone)  
**Subject:** Psst... there's more (4 agents, unlimited power)

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

So far you've seen the code review agent. But there are 3 more:

✓ **Test Generator:** Creates tests automatically. Cuts QA time by 50%.
✓ **Documentation Bot:** Generates Swagger + comments. Never update docs manually again.
✓ **Deploy Guard:** Pre-flight checks before production. Catches bugs before they bite you.

Most people activate all 4 by day 5.

→ Explore all agents: [LINK TO DASHBOARD]

Fair warning: Once you use the test generator, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

Cheers,
[Agent Name]
```

**CTA:** "See All Agents"  
**Success Event:** Lead explores additional agents

### Email 4: Testimonial + Proof (Social Proof)
**Trigger:** 6 days into trial  
**Send:** Day 6, 9 AM  
**Subject:** How Marcus saved 30 hours/month (and his sanity)

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Real quick story.

Marcus runs a dev agency. 8 developers. Tight margins.

Before TitanForge: Spending 2-3 hours/day on code reviews and bug triage. 
That's 15 hours/week of expensive dev time wasted on stuff that doesn't scale.

After TitanForge: AI handles all the routine stuff. His team focuses on architecture 
and features. Result? They can take on 3x more projects without hiring new devs.

Margin went from 15% to 45%.

The point: You're probably doing the same thing. Hours lost on busywork every week.

TitanForge handles that. Automates it. Scales it.

Same opportunity. Same timeline. Different choice.

**Success Event:** Lead views pricing

### Email 5: Trial Ending Soon (Urgency + Offer)
**Trigger:** 12 days into trial  
**Send:** Day 12, 2 PM  
**Subject:** Your trial ends in 2 days. Here's why you'll want to stay.

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Your 14-day trial expires on [DATE].

Before you go, I want to be honest: The real ROI from TitanForge hits in week 2-3, 
once you've set up all the agents and they're running on everything you ship.

That's when the time savings compound. That's when you start wondering 
how you ever shipped code without it.

**Here's the deal:**

Convert to Pro today and I'll give you:
- 20% off your first 3 months (we're talking $79/month instead of $99)
- Priority support (I'll personally help with setup)
- A 30-day money-back guarantee

→ Lock in the discount: [LINK TO UPGRADE]

This isn't a hard sell. But I've seen people regret not staying on. 
You're 2 days away from a permanent productivity boost. Might be worth it.

Cheers,
[Agent Name]

P.S. – Seriously, if you're on the fence, reply to this. Let's chat about 
whether it's the right move for you. No pressure.
```

**CTA:** "Upgrade to Pro"  
**Success Event:** Conversion to paid

**Subject:** Hey [First Name], what happened?

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Your trial just ended. I'm curious what happened.

Did TitanForge not fit your workflow? Was there a feature missing? 
Or did life just get in the way?

Either way, I'd love to know. Honest feedback helps us build better.

Or if you want to hop back on, upgrading is one click away. 
No hard feelings either way.

Cheers,

**Send:** After 3rd limit hit  
**Subject:** You're crushing it. Time to level up?

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

You've hit the test generation limit 3 times this month. 
That means you've found the value. 👏

Upgrade to Pro and you get unlimited everything. Plus custom agents, 
priority support, and all the new features we're shipping.

For someone using this as much as you, Pro pays for itself in time savings alone.

But before we do: Is there something broken? A feature missing? 
Something we didn't explain well?

just reply "keep" and we'll extend you another 30 days.

Thanks for giving TitanForge a try.
